    Driver for GALFIT on Clusters Galaxies


A longer description of your project goes here...
It takes an input catalog of Sextractor (or Clusex) and it re-format it 
to run GALFIT on every object in the image. Later, it computes the photometric
parameters of every surface brightness model fitted with GALFIT.
